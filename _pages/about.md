I was trained in applied mathematics, optimization and machine learning where I had spent several years on studying support vector machines. During my Ph.D training under the supervision of Prof. Naiyang Deng and [Dr. Gary Bader](https://baderlab.org/), I started to gain expertise in computational biology and bioinformatics, and had developed support vector machine oriented tools for quantitavely predict protein domain-pepetide interactions. After gratudation, I started a position at Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Science, where I extent my research interests to the genomic/epigenomic field and had dedicated to decipher the DNA methylation patterns dynamics within cell-population. Later on, I joined McGill Genome Center as a postdoctoral fellow and subsequently research staff under the supervision of [Dr. Tomi Pastinen](https://www.childrensmercy.org/profiles/tomi-pastinen/), [Dr. Elin Grundberg](https://www.childrensmercy.org/profiles/elin-grundberg/) and [Dr. Guillaume Bourque](https://computationalgenomics.ca/montreal-team/). During that peroid, I worked on developing computational methods for analyzing whole genome bisulfite sequencing and capture sequencing data, looking at genetic and epigenetic impacts in human complex diseases. 

I collaborate extensively with biologists and clinicians to investigate the genetic and environmental effects on human complex diseases including metabolic, immune, neurodegenerative diseases as well as reproductive diseases. I help the biologists and clinicians to make sense of data.

I have opportunities for Masters or Ph.D students to assist with various research projects related to AI in biological systems and computational epigonomics. These positions will be co-supervised with Canadian university professors. Please email me with transcripts and CV if interested.
